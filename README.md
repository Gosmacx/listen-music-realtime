# listen-music-realtime

A `demo` application where you can listen to music in **Real Time**.

<br>

**How is it working?**

- This project is made with `socket.io`

- Someone entering the room for the **first time** asks the **Party Starter** what time the song is. That's why I put the Start Party button. In this way, the person who presses the **Start Party** button helps those who enter the room for the **first time**.

- My application where you can listen to real-time music: [Listo](https://gosmacx.netlify.app)
